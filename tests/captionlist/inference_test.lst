Thunder roars loudly as heavy rain falls onto a metallic roof, with occasional wind gusts blowing through trees and distant lightning strikes echoing in the background
A racing car engine revs up and speeds past while tires screech against asphalt, followed by the sound of emergency sirens wailing in the distance and wind blowing into a microphone
A classical piano arpeggio played softly in a large concert hall with natural reverb, gradually building up intensity as orchestral strings and woodwinds join in, creating a cinematic atmosphere
A large crowd chattering excitedly in a stadium, followed by sudden cheering and applause as fireworks explode in the distance with echoing booms
Heavy footsteps walking on creaky wooden floorboards in an empty mansion, with thunder rumbling outside and rain hitting stained glass windows
A bustling city intersection with car horns honking, construction work drilling, subway trains rumbling underground, and street vendors calling out
Water droplets falling into a deep cave with natural reverb, accompanied by distant wind howling through rocky tunnels and occasional bat squeaks
Create an epic orchestral piece with dramatic brass swells, driving percussion, soaring string melodies, and a grand choir building to a powerful climax
